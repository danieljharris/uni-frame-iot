# esp_rest_v3
This is a project for the ESP8266 to allow for a plug and play REST network of devices.

The way it works is as follows:
1) The first ESP powerd up will create a WiFi access point, you connect to this using your phone, then select a WiFi network from the drop down menu and enter the password.
2) The ESP then connects to the given WiFi point, and creats a new access point for future ESP devices.
3) Any further ESP devices powered on will now detect the first ESP, and get the WiFi login information from it, meaning you only need to enter you WiFi details once.
4) You can then access any device using the endpoints accessable at 192.168.1.100 (Configurable in the code) or via esp8266.local

Some notes about how it works:
* All ESP devices are communicated to via the first powered on ESP (known as the master). Which device is the master is not relavant, as all devices are access the same.
* You communicate to the endpoints using Json and you specify which ESP to use using its "name", which can be changed via an endpoint.
